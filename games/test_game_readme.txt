STATUS OF TEST_GAME.WDL

The game is now loadable and beatable, but several parts of it are not functional as intended

-the only item findable within the game is the sign in the initial room. All other items cannot be found by "LOOK"ing for them or attempting to interact with them in any other way.

-the end room is enterable by simply typing GO DOWN from the first room, despite the locked trapdoor. 

Hopefully these aspects will be improved over time as the WDL itself and my understanding of it are improved.
